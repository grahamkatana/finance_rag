# Voice input and read-aloud (0.3.0, code 6)

Added 7 October 2026. Same design in Book RAG 0.2.0 (code 3).

- **Dictation**: microphone button beside Send. Uses the phone's `SpeechRecognizer` (en-ZA, partial results), so words appear in the box as you speak. Permission `RECORD_AUDIO` is asked on first tap. The app never stores audio; only the text reaches the server.
- **Read aloud**: speaker icon in the top bar turns on automatic reading of each new answer, sentence by sentence while it streams (`SpeechFeed`). Each finished answer also has a Read aloud / Stop button. Sending, opening a chat or turning the toggle off stops the voice.
- Answers already on screen are never read unasked.
- Pure logic is in `SpeakableText.kt` (markdown, citation markers, tables and code removed; sentence chunking), with `SpeakableTextTest.kt`. Engine wrappers are in `Voice.kt`.
- Manifest: `RECORD_AUDIO`, microphone `uses-feature required=false`, `<queries>` for the recogniser and TTS service (needed on Android 11+).

**Verified**: unit tests pass; release build installs and launches on emulator Light_API_35 without a crash.
**Not verified**: real speech recognition and voice quality (needs a phone with Google speech services; the emulator was run without audio), and the signed-in chat screen on the emulator (no test login used).
